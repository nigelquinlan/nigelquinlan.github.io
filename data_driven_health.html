									<h3 class="major">Better data for managers</h3>
									
									<p>
										The challenge with this project was to create better ways to serve the right information in the right way at the right time for these busy managers.
									</p>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/data_driven_health.JPG" alt="coloured post-it notes arranged on butcher paper with a title 'Outcomes' handwritten" /></span></div>
									
									<p>
										This project started out as a '<em>new ways of working</em>' program sponsored by the People & Culture team at Epworth. The objective of introducing new ways of working was to apply new approaches to solving the most complex workplace challenges and to make a genuine difference for patients and staff. To achieve this, I worked with a coalition of the willing to help them to foster their curiosity and improve their openness to change.
									</p>
									<p>
										We started with a guided journey through the <strong>Design Thinking</strong> process. Design Thinking is a problem exploring and ideas development methodology that is centred around people. It starts with a <strong>discover</strong> phase where a team will explore the challenge and conduct some research. Then they <strong>define</strong> the problem they want to solve in a way that leaves multiple potential solutions. Next they <strong>develop</strong> potential solutions and finally when a solution is tested and, potentially, has gone through several iterations, comes a <strong>deliver</strong> phase. In the deliver phase, the team might hand over to a project team to implement ths solution into the organisation or they might work alongside a business team to help with the implementation.
									</p>

									<p>
										During this problem exploration phase, one team had a vision for a better way of handling <em>mandatory training</em> data at a ward level. In a hospital environment, mandatory training ranges from hand washing to potentially life saving interventions. All mandatory training is closely monitored by managers and is reported to the executive team on a monthly basis. This team had identified a potential for improving the availability and format of training data. serving up mandatory training data at a ward level. During a design phase I worked closely with this team to design and develop a dashboard for nurse unit managers. We developed a minimum viable product (MVP) and this went into use on a selected ward as a proof of concept.
									</p>

									<p>
										The legacy at Epworth was empowerment of key individuals to drive a new culture of collaboration and innovation. The outcome of our proof of concept was shared with managers and the team responsible for building out information dashboards.
									</p>

									<p>
										Epworth HealthCare, based in Melbourne Australia, is the state of Victoriaâ€™s largest not-for-profit private healthcare group, renowned for excellence in diagnosis, treatment, care, and rehabilitation. As a leading teaching hospital with 2,050 doctors and specialists, and 5,220 clinical and support workers on staff, the institution also has 3,000 students flowing through its organisation every year.
