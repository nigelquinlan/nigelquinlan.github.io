									<h3 class="major">Problem Statement</h3>
									<p>As part of my Data Analytics Immersive at General Assembly I was asked to select a topic for my capstone project. I chose to review recent parking events available on the City of Melbourne Open Data portal. My challenge was to identify which parking bays were resulting in the highest number of violations and to make recommendations on which parking bays could be repurposed by the city for other community uses.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Approach</h3>
									<p>Python & Tableau are best buddies and I used both to visualise all parking violations in the Melbourne before focussing on an area close to my ❤️, Victoria Market. As a cyclist and marketgoer, I investigated which parking could be repurposed for other members of the community.</p>
									
									<p>At the core of all innovation efforts, the ability to align a product or a service with the needs of the people you have identified as most likely to gain some sort of value from using the product or service, is an approach that radically improves the chances of success.
									Design Thinking is a problem exploring and ideas Development methodology that is centred around people.
									<br><br>
									This project started out as a 'new ways of working' program sponsored by the People & Culure team at Epworth. The objective of introducing new ways was to be able to apply new approaches to solving the most complex workplace challenges. To achieve this, I worked with a coalition of the willing to help them embrace curiosity and improve their openness to change.<br>Following on from this I guided them through the Design Thinking process. When it came to applying this new found practice and knowledge, three teams were formed, one of which had a vision for a better way of capturing mandatory training data at a ward level.
									I worked closely with this team to design and develop a dashboard for nurse unit managers to minimum viable product stage.</p>

									<p>The legacy at Epworth was empowerment of key individuals to drive a new culture of collaboration and innovation.</p>

									<p>
									Epworth HealthCare, based in Melbourne Australia, is the state of Victoria’s largest not-for-profit private healthcare group, renowned for excellence in diagnosis, treatment, care, and rehabilitation. As a leading teaching hospital with 2,050 doctors and specialists, and 5,220 clinical and support workers on staff, the institution also has 3,000 students flowing through its organisation every year.
